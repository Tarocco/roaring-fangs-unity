- Makes toast
- Looks good
- Umm..I forgot?

Build
-----
This library depends on projects in the `/.Projects` directory. First and foremost, build them, or you can just rely on the prebuilt assemblies in `/Assemblies`. The choice is yours. If you update or modify the libraries in `/.Projects`, you will need to rebuild them as Unity will not build their source files. Instead, they are built separately and the dynamically linked.
